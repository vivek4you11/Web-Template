                <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after
                    the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.</p>
                <p> Constructed from 1887–89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of
                    France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of
                    France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited
                    paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. </p>
                <p>The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest
                    structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.</p>
                <p>The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's
                    upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public
                    in the European Union. </p>
